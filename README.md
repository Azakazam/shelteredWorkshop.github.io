# shelteredWorkshop.github.io
This was another project during my 2nd year, making a website using html/css and PHP/MySQL. 

The main focus again was to develop and connect a database using mysql, but this time was to focus on collecting data from users based on their rank aswell as managing the data that is updated, added and deleted from the database.

This project is where I gained experience from making use of back-end technolgies
